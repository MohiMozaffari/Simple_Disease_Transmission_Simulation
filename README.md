# C++ Disease Transmission Simulation

## Overview

This C++ program simulates the transmission of a disease within a population. The simulation is implemented using a simple ring model where individuals can be in different states: susceptible, infected, or recovered.

## Features

- Random initialization of infected individuals in the population.
- Simulation of disease transmission based on specified parameters.
- Visualization of the initial and final states of the population.
